   VELORA — V7: customer_address.city_id becomes nullable

   Run once against the `velora` database.

   The business decision documented in the API contract is that a saved
   address captures the city as free text (folded into `area`) and the
   governorate alone drives shipping — `city_id` was never meant to be a
   required foreign key. The column was left over from an earlier design
   and is still `BIGINT NOT NULL`, so every `POST /api/v1/me/addresses`
   fails with a NOT NULL violation: the request has no `cityId` field to
   populate it with.

   This script relaxes the constraint the code already assumes. The
   `fk_addr_city` foreign key is left in place — NULL values never
   participate in a foreign key check, so a customer who has no city
   reference row simply leaves the column NULL.

   Safe to run again on a database where it already applied.
